    <h1>a Theremin Works</h1>
    <p>Before we get to how a theremin works, lets first discuss what a theremin is and how one plays it.  It is a musical instrument that was invented by a russian physicist named Leon Theremin in 1920 (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin#History">Wikipedia article</a> for more of the history).  There are two antennas that protrude out of the device with which one controls the volume and the pitch of the instrument.  The antenna on the left is for volume and the antenna on the right is for pitch.  To adjust the pitch, one moves one's hand closer to the pitch antenna to increase the pitch, and further from the antenna to decrease the pitch.  The instrument is set to be silent by touching the volume antenna, and it gradually gets louder as one moves one's hand away from it.</p>

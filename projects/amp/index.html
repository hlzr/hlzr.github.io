<h1>Guitar Amplifier Project</h1>

<h2>Champ Project</h2>
<p>
  This page documents a guitar amplifier project I completed in 2011. It works and sounds great; it has served my primary amp that I play at home for over a year now.  I might cover the cabinet; I might not.  I've also thought about just painting it in a glossy color.

  The basic design <!-- Please let me know if there is a copyright issue from posting the schematic or layout here --> (<a href="schematic.gif">schematic</a>, <a href="layout.gif">layout</a>) is that of a Fender Champ 5F1.  It uses a 12AX7 for the preamplifier section and a 6V6GT for the power amplifier section in a cascaded Class A configuration.  I also decided to keep the original tube power supply (using a 5Y3GT rectifier).

  Approach high voltage DC electronics (such as a guitar amp) with 
  <blink>EXTREME CAUTION</blink>...<blink>POINTING AT THE WRONG THING CAN KILL YOU</blink>.

<p>
  My advice would be to find a person that repairs old tube televisions (or at 
  one point in time did).  Or maybe find a store that still sells tubes and hang 
  out there a bit...learn from others...<u>DON'T DIE!</u>
